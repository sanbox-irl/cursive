    /// You can use the given id to find the view in the layout tree.

    /// # Examples
    ///
    /// ```rust
    /// # use cursive_core::Cursive;
    /// # use cursive_core::views::TextView;
    /// # use cursive_core::view::Resizable;
    /// use cursive_core::view::Nameable;
    ///

    /// siv.add_layer(
    ///     TextView::new("foo")
    ///         .with_name("text")
    ///         .fixed_width(10)
    /// );

    /// // You could call this from an event callback
    /// siv.call_on_name("text", |view: &mut TextView| {

    ///
    /// You should call this directly on the view you want to retrieve later,
    /// before other wrappers like [`fixed_width`]. Otherwise, you would be
    /// retrieving a [`ResizedView`]!
